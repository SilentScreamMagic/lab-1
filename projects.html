        <h2>Database Project - ParaSite</h2>
        <p>
            ParaSite is meant to be a user-based scheduling app to allow users to post their assignments and upcoming commitments for 
            reminders and share with their collegues to keep everyone upto date everything they have to do. Users can subscribe to each 
            other or groups for multiple sources of prompts for their work, be it class assignments, team meetings, upcoming events 
            or party. You may forget about your commitments, but odds are not everyone will, so let's leech off each other and keep everyone
            on track for all our sakes.

        <h2>Global Game Jam Project - Is you is or is you ain't my robot?</h2>
        <p>
            Global Game Jam is a 3 day game development competiton that is held usually in January and I took part in it at the start
            of the year with fellow ashesi students. With the theme of repair, we decided to develop a game with a similar concept. The user has a stun gun and a
            repair device. The user has to face a robot in a room that has other destroyed robot parts. The users are allowed to fix 
            near by robots to fight with them in order to defeat all enemies in the room but there's a catch. Not all robots are allies
            and are indistinguishable from the ally robots. Players may end up with a new friend or foe. Though we weren't able to finish
            in time for a complete submittion, we do plan on completing it if time permits us.
