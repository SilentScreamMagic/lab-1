           I was born and raised in Ghana for all of my life. Born to two doctors, I am
           the second of three boys. Despite both our parents being Ghanain, we speak no 
           other language but english. Ironically, as if to compensate for this in a twisted 
           but humuorous way, I learnt a few programing languages to a basic level.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
           Though I don't know as much about Ghana as I should, I have been interested in western
           and eastern comics/manga and other media. My brother's are the same as me, as horrifying
           as the implication of two other versions of me may be. This made me never really feel alone
           even with at times unpopular or unheard of tastes in music like AJR and series like Love is War
           among my classmates so I tried stuck out in a more relatable, programming.<br>
        </p>
        <p>   
           I was introduced to programming by my uncle and mentor Patrick Djan-Sampson who
           gave me a NXT Lego Mindstorm kit to code with when I was around 12 and started me down the path
           to be a computer scientist, one that I still on today.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
           It wasn't easy. I had a lot of failings caused by me being over-confident and being
           the one student doing computer science at high school, but it did pay off by giving 
           me a leg up over some of my collegues in Ashesi. Lessons of the past have taught me 
           that I learn a lot from others and you can never know everything and with that in mind,
           i completed my first semester as tutor for the freshmen and it was thrilling. As I am
           graduating in 2022, I only have a few more semesters left and I intend to make the most
           of the time as a tutor that I have.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to live up to the expectations people have for me and maybe even excel enough to have some patents
            like my uncle and inspire another you programmer like he inspired me.<br>
